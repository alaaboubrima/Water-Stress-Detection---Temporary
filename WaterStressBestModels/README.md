# Water Stress Best Model

## Overview
This folder contains the best-performing models for detecting water stress in SugarBeet plant. The primary model is based on the Inception V3 architecture with custom adjustments (accuracy of 99.7% on a never seen dataset). Additionally, a YOLO model is used for detecting plants in images and videos.

## Models
- **InceptionV3_Model**: Contains the trained Inception V3 model.
- **YOLO_Model**: Contains the YOLO model for plant detection.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `InceptionV3_Model` or `YOLO_Model` directory.
2. Load the model using your preferred deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
3. Use the model to make predictions on new images or videos.
